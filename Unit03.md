**Unit 3: Pointers and References in C++** <span id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, students will cultivate a deeper understanding of how
variables are declared and represented in memory.  Students will also
learn about pointers and how they can be used to reference certain
memory locations.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 3 hours to complete.

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Describe the design and implementations of variable declarations.
-   Describe the use and implementations of Pointers.

**3.1 Programming Abstractions** <span id="3.1"></span> 
-   **Lecture: Stanford University Course on Programming Abstractions:

     Instructions: Please click the link above and view the video in its
    entirety (41:45) to gain an understanding of programming
    abstractions such as *pointers*, *recursive data*, and *linked
    lists*.

**3.2 Pointing to Memory** <span id="3.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: CPlusPlus.com’s “Pointers”**
    Link: CPlusPlus.com’s
    [“Pointers”](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/pointers/)
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: This reading covers subunit 3.2.  The declaration,
    use, and dereferencing of pointers is covered in the sections
    “Reference Operators,” “Dereference Operators,” “Declaring Variables
    of Pointers Types,” and “Pointers and Arrays” sections of the
    reading.  A pointer references a location in memory, and obtaining
    the value at the location a pointer refers to is known as
    “dereferencing the pointer.”  Several languages support some type of
    pointer.  Here we look into the fundamentals behind pointing to an
    item in the memory.  
        
     This reading should take you approximately 1 hour to complete.

     Instructions: Please complete all questions in this quiz.  
        
     This assessment should take you approximately 15 minutes to

    Link: CPlusPlus.com’s
    [“Pointers”](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/pointers/) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: This reading covers subunit 3.3. The pointer
    arithmetic involving adding a number to a pointer variable, and
    adding a number to a dereferenced pointer array, are covered in the
    “Pointer Initialization,” “Pointer Arithmetic,” and “Pointers to
    Pointers” sections of the reading.  When you are pointing to
    something in memory, you need to be able to continue to point to the
    right item depending on the need for computation.  This requires
    advancing pointers and taking steps back if needed.  All of this
    needs pointer arithmetic.  Knowledge of pointer arithmetic separates
    those who passably know C from those who know C really well.  It's
    said that a good programmer understands pointers very well, while an
    average programmer *finds anything with more than one pointer
    difficult to manage.  This unit will help you make progress towards
    becoming a good programmer.*
