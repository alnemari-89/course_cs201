**Unit 5: Linked Stacks, Queues, and Lists** <span id="5"></span> 
*This unit will introduce students to three new types of Data
Structures: Linked Stacks, Queues, and lists.  We will discuss their
respective operations and learn how the use of node classes and pointers
can provide us with a means of implementing them. *

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 1.25 hours to complete.

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Describe the design and implementations of Stacks, Queues, and
    Lists.
-   Describe the use of operations involved in Stacks, Queues, and
    Lists.

    “[Queues](http://library.thinkquest.org/C005618/text/queues.htm)”
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: This reading covers the empty method, the append
    methods, the server methods, and the private attributes associated
    with linked queues.  Please read this webpage in its entirety.  The
    web page provides information about Linked Queues as a Class with
    examples in C++.

    Arrays](http://www.functionx.com/cpp/articles/linkedlist.htm)”
    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please read the linked page in its entirety; the
    author provides information about creating linked lists with arrays
    using examples from C++.  You will learn about the fixed size
    implementation, the overhead in shuffling, and implementation of a
    list with nodes as a class.
