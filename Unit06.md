**Unit 6: Algorithm Efficiency** <span id="6"></span> 
*There are a number of parameters that developers must consider when
designing Data Structures.  One of the most important parameters relates
to the efficiency of the algorithms (i.e. searching algorithms) that can
be used on the Data Structures.  This unit will explain how to measure
an algorithm’s efficiency, identify problems that arise when taking
these measurements, and present ways of representing algorithm
efficiency.*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 1.75 hours to complete.

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Describe the efficiency of searching and sorting algorithms by using
    arrays.
-   Explain best, average, and worst-cases of an algorithm by using
    Big-O notation.
