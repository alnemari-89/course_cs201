**Unit 1: Abstract Data Types and Arrays in C++** <span id="1"></span> 
**This unit will introduce students to Abstract Data Types and will make
the important distinction between an Abstract Data Type and a Data
Structure.  Students will also learn about arrays (a specific type of
Data Structure) and the abstracted form of the array data type in C++.**

**1.1.1 Definition of Abstract Data Types** <span id="1.1.1"></span> 
*This subunit is covered by the “Abstract Data Types” reading assigned
at the outset of subunit 1.1 above.  You should read the “Data
Abstraction” and “The Definitions in an ADT” sections of the reading to
get a good understanding of Abstract Data Types.  An ADT is a
mathematical model that captures the problem domain in order to
translate it into a program; some examples of ADTs include queues,
lists, stacks, trees, graphs, and sets.*   
  
 This reading should take you approximately 20 minutes to complete.

**1.1.2 Fundamentals of ADT Implementation** <span id="1.1.2"></span> 
*This subunit is covered by the “Abstract Data Types” reading assigned
at the outset of subunit 1.1 above.  You should read the “Implementation
Details” section of the reading to get a good understanding of how one
can go about implementing Abstract Data Types.  Since an ADT represents
a mathematical model, an implementation of these models makes them
accessible to computer programs.  At this point you should think about
what data types would be needed and what operations you would be
performing on these data types.  All of this is explained in the reading
through the use of a class ADT.*  
  
 This reading should take you approximately 20 minutes to complete.

     Instructions: Please read through the webpage in its entirety to
    get an understanding of different types of linked lists, including
    endogenous and exogenous linked lists.  This reading covers subunits
    1.2.2.2.1 and 1.2.2.2.2 of this unit.    
      
     This reading should take you approximately 1 hour to complete.

**1.2.2.2.1 Endogenous** <span id="1.2.2.2.1"></span> 
*This subunit is covered by the “Linked List Variations” reading
assigned in subunit 1.2.2.2.  You should read the “Endogenous Linked
Lists” section of the reading to get a good understanding of endogenous
linked lists.  Endogenous linked lists store links within the data. 
Typically, most linked lists store links outside of the data. 
Endogenous linked lists are useful in system programming tasks.*  
  
 This reading should take you approximately 30 minutes to complete.

**1.2.2.2.2 Exogenous** <span id="1.2.2.2.2"></span> 
*This subunit is covered by the “Linked List Variations” reading
assigned in subunit 1.2.2.2.  You should read the “Doubly-Linked List,”
“Cyclic Lists,” and “Dummy Nodes” sections of the reading to get a good
understanding of exogenous linked lists.  As we discussed before, most
linked lists store links outside of the data; these types of linked
lists are called “exogenous” linked lists. In this reading we study
doubly-linked lists and cyclic lists as examples of exogenous linked
lists.*  
  
 This reading should take you approximately 30 minutes to complete.

**1.3.1 Elements and Dimension of an Array** <span id="1.3.1"></span> 
*This subunit is covered by the “Arrays: Lesson I” reading listed in
subunit 1.3 above.  You should read the introductory section of the
reading to get a good understanding of the elements and dimensions of an
array.  An array is a series of elements of the same type placed in
contiguous memory locations that can be individually referenced by
adding an index to a unique identifier.  The number of elements in the
array leads to the concept of the dimension of an array, and each item
stored in there is an element.  In this subunit we study how to access
the elements of an array within the bounds of the dimensions of an
array.*  
  
 This reading should take you approximately 5 minutes to complete.

**1.3.2 Array Basics** <span id="1.3.2"></span> 
*This subunit is covered by the “Arrays: Lesson I” and “Arrays: Lesson
II” readings listed in subunit 1.3 above.  You should read the
“Initializing Arrays” and “Accessing the Values of an Array” sections to
get a good understanding of basic operations on an array.  Sections
4.1.1, 4.1.2, and 4.1.3 of “Arrays: Lesson II” give you C/C++ examples
of array initializations.  At any point of a program in which an array
is visible, we can access the value of any of its elements individually
as if it were a normal variable, and thus we are able to both read and
modify its value.  The reading for this subunit explains this aspect of
working with arrays using examples.*  
  
 This reading should take you approximately 20 minutes to complete.

**1.3.3 Strings as Arrays** <span id="1.3.3"></span> 
*This subunit is covered by the “Arrays: Lesson II” reading listed in
subunit 1.3 above.  You should review the example in “4.1.7: Array of
Strings” to get a good understanding of basic operations on an array of
strings.  The example shows how to store the days of the week as an
array of strings and then access each element of the array of strings
just as you would access any other array. *  
  
 This reading should take you approximately 5 minutes to complete.

**1.3.4 Multidimensional Arrays** <span id="1.3.4"></span> 
*This subunit is covered by the “Arrays: Lesson I” reading listed in
subunit 1.3 above.  You should read the “Multidimensional Arrays”
section of the “Arrays: Lesson I” reading to get a good understanding of
basic operations on an array.  Multidimensional arrays can be described
as "arrays of arrays."  For example, a two-dimensional array can be
thought of as a matrix of elements that are of a uniform data type.  But
multidimensional arrays are not limited to two dimensions.  We look into
some examples of multidimensional arrays and their implementation in
C.*  
  
 This reading should take you approximately 5 minutes to complete.
